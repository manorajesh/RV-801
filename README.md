# RV-801
A RISC-V tiny computer designed to eduate

## Steps
1. Implement ISA (Basic).
2. Simulate CPU: Write code to simulate basic CPU operations based on your ISA.
3. Memory and I/O: Implement a memory model and basic I/O operations.
4. Assembler/Compiler: Create a tool to convert high-level code to your tiny computer's machine code.
6. Graphics and Sound: If applicable, implement simple graphic and sound capabilities.
7. Design learning framework (game and engine design).

## Why
Help eduate people on how assembly and CPUs works. Additionally, quell my thirst to design a CPU emulator.
